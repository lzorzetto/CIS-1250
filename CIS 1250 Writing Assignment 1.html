  <h1>Mauris Tincidunt</h1>
  <p>An example of software that I personally use, and think is well designed, is the game Hayday. This is a mobile game which simulates a farmer’s experience. I believe this software was designed well because of its commitment to user-friendly interface. Firstly, software design is important since its functionality impacts the user’s experience. This can be seen in Hayday since it is a software that resonates with all audiences is as the game is not difficult to understand or play. This makes the game is user-friendly and allows for the easy navigation of the game. The game is focused on experience of players who play the game. This is evident as the game does not force any teaching on how to play the game, meaning the user is able to determine how they want to play. Another element of the game which encourages users is the level system. Players will earn XP points by completing and preforming. By gaining points, players level up, and unlock new features, which keeps the gameplay exciting. Secondly, updates are critical while designing software. Bug fixes, user experience, adaptations, are all important in maintain the quality of a software. Part of the software design process is maintaining the application, because of technology continuously evolving, applications need to be updated and reviewed regularly. Though Hayday not being a new game, the software updates and user experiences keep it fresh and intriguing. As a result of its excellent software design, Hayday has withstood the test of time, with its original release being 12 years ago. This remains a popular mobile game which is still enjoyed by audiences today. </p>
