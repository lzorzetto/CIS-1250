  <p>An example of software that I personally use, and think is well designed, is the game Hayday. This is a mobile game which simulates a farmer’s experience. I believe this software was designed well because of its commitment to user-friendly interface. Firstly, software design is important since its functionality impacts the user’s experience. This can be seen in Hayday since it is a software that resonates with all audiences is as the game is not difficult to understand or play. This makes the game is user-friendly and allows for the easy navigation of the game. The game is focused on experience of players who play the game. This is evident as the game does not force any teaching on how to play the game, meaning the user is able to determine how they want to play. Another element of the game which encourages users is the level system. Players will earn XP points by completing and preforming. By gaining points, players level up, and unlock new features, which keeps the gameplay exciting. Secondly, updates are critical while designing software. Bug fixes, user experience, adaptations, are all important in maintain the quality of a software. Part of the software design process is maintaining the application, because of technology continuously evolving, applications need to be updated and reviewed regularly. Though Hayday not being a new game, the software updates and user experiences keep it fresh and intriguing. As a result of its excellent software design, Hayday has withstood the test of time, with its original release being 12 years ago. This remains a popular mobile game which is still enjoyed by audiences today. </p>

  <p>1.	In the requirements gathering stage, developers are expected to figure out what problem they are solving, and who will be using the product they are creating. To solve these questions, developers must talk to customers by asking questions and communicating ideas to curate a clear and concise description of what the client needs. In software, requirements are a set of operations that the program must preform. This is an important stage in the software development process as it helps the developer understand the problem the product will be solving and what the users should gain/be able to do with the product. Additionally, it is the foundation for the following stages of the software development process since it acts as a guide for the development. “Good” requirements, are essential for the proper development of software. “Good” requirements must be clear, concise, measurable, and testable. Also, by creating a document of good requirements, developers prevent misunderstandings and disagreements about expectations.</p>

  <p>Communication is important in software design because it makes sure everyone on the project is on the same page and ensures the development of software products goes accordingly. Effective communication between design teams and clients helps to clarify the requirements and expectations of the product being made. Key elements of effective communication in the design process include clarity (being clear and concise), non-verbal communication, and being open-minded. <br/><br/>
<b>Clarity</b> is necessary to make sure ideas and concepts are being explained in an understandable way. This includes making requirements short and each requirement only explains one point. This way of representing requirements minimizes misunderstandings between the client and software design team.<br/><br/>
<b>Non-verbal communication</b> includes paying attention to others in discussions by actively listening. By actively listening you can determine the other party’s concerns and views on the topic, leading to further discussions and collaboration.<br/><br/>
Being <b>open-minded</b> allows for new ideas to be represented, and alternate views to be seen. This includes cultural differences that may diversify the product or the market using it. Design teams should remain open-minded throughout communication with clients and adapt requirements with new understandings.<br/><br/>

In a past computer science project in high school, there was a miscommunication between me and my partner regarding our responsibilities of the project. The project was for us to build a basic software game. Throughout discussing the game, we wished to build, we defined some basic requirements it should have and some estimated due dates for those requirements. However, we never clearly assigned individual responsibilities, resulting in us making duplicates of some of the requirements, and left us doing more work then necessary. Given what learned in class, I now know the importance of declaring responsibilities at the beginning of a project, and regular check-ins to ensure we are on the same page. </p>

  <p>The twelfth design principle is regular adaptation to changing circumstances. This principle highlights the continuous improvements to the design by evaluating issues and experiences of user to better improve the software. This principle is critical to improving the performance and experience for user’s while accommodating changing conditions. In software design, it is important to regularly assess software and deploy adaptations because user needs and the market are constantly changing. By assessing software regularly, analyzing potential issues, and learning from user feedback, programmers make sure their software designs remain user-friendly, up-to date, and efficient. In turn this improves the users experience, and the quality of the software. Two examples of this principle are Duolingo and the healthcare system. <br/><br/>
    
Duolingo is an educational software that allows users to learn new languages. The app regularly adapts to the user’s needs by continually assessing the user’s success and rate of repeated lessons. The program uses this information to adapt the way it teaches the user, by adjusting lesson difficulty or the area of focus. Additionally, Duolingo improves its curriculum by receiving user feedback. The app is regularly updated to align with user needs (such as new languages) to improve user satisfaction. <br/><br/>

In addition, the healthcare system is another domain where continuous change is important. Healthcare workers are required to regularly provide updates on treatments or practices based on new data. An example of this would be during the COVID-19 pandemic, where healthcare providers took new evidence, and regularly updated safety protections (such as quarantines, or social distancing) to keep the public healthy. </p>
